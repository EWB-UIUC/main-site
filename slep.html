info: The Soppo Likoko Power Project aims to provide electricity to 50 households and 4 schools in Soppo Likoko, Cameroon by constructing an electrical grid system. This grid system will consist of transmission lines, poles, and in-house wiring. In addition to the construction of the system, the project team is working on creating an education program in order to ensure that safe electricity usage is practiced after the system has been implemented. <br><br> In order to promote community involvement, the project has strengthened its ties with the people of Soppo Likoko over the course of two assessment trips. The assessment trips have also allowed the project team to determine the transmission line route and estimate the implementation costs. Currently, the project is in the design phase and the team is working on preparing for an implementation trip late this summer. The community and the project team are both excited for the construction of the project to begin!
