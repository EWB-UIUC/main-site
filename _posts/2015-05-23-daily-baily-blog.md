This morning we tried to have a water committee meeting. We met at the water chairman’s home however we did not have enough attendance so we went home. This village is helping me learn more about patience. I am realizing that if a meeting doesn’t work one day, you must keep trying until you succeed.

Afterwards we went for a long hike to see a waterfall. The waterfall is called Kofatar. It translates to the son gives to the father. The waterfall is made up of three separate waterfalls, the son a short heavy waterfall, the mother a long spidery fall and the father the largest waterfall of them all. It was great to learn about the history of the falls and the people who had first settled there.

After our adventure, the rain set in fast and hard. That is another thing about Ntisaw that I am starting to appreciate. When the rain comes everything else stops. All you can do is rush indoors and wait for it to be over. We have a few of the village children in our home with us so we teach them how to play Uno. We spend the rest of the afternoon laughing and listening to the rain pound on the tin roof.
