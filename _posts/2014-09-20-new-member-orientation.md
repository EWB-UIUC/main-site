title: New Member Orientation
---

Our chapter hosted an orientation session to integrate new members with various projects. We hope that newer members are able to adapt to our on-going projects and get exposed to important elements & skill sets needed to succeed in a project. Project leads coordinated hands-on activities to convey information on their respective projects and help new members transition smoothly!
