This morning we started off the day by having another women’s meeting. With them we discussed the library as well as the problem of the high iron content. The biggest thing that we wanted to ensure was that the water from the taps, although less appealing, was still safer to drink than the water from the stream. We helped them understand that iron is a type two contaminant and that it has no negative health effects, if anything a little bit of iron can be good for a woman’s health.  However, our system has more than a little bit of iron so we discussed with them the solutions that we have to reduce it.

Afterwards I went to the Islamic school with a few of our team members to teach a lesson. As education lead for our team, I was completely in charge. My main goal for the lesson was to teach a bit of English as well as make the learning fun for the children. Ntisaw has a problem with children not wanting to continue with higher education because education is not seen as something necessary there. I know that I cannot change their lives with one lesson, but if I could I would want them to enjoy learning and have a passion to continue with their education.  However, these children are ages six to twelve and with the addition of the language barrier I really only have their attention for twenty minutes. Because of that I chose a simple lesson of the five senses.

I started the lesson was touch, passing around felt and sandpaper. Then I talked about smell and had them smell two vials, one with water the other with spice. For sound I played my harmonica and did a clapping exercise. For taste they all got a piece of candy. And for sight they experienced the different colors by drawling on a five senses coloring sheet. We finished off the lesson by teaching them a short song about the five senses. All in all, I think that the lesson went well. The kids all learned a few more words of English and spent the rest of the day singing the song that we had taught them.
