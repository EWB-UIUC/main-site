Today is our last morning in Ntisaw. We leave at 11 am. Marceline makes us a big breakfast of spaghetti eggs and bread. She baked us an extra loaf to take in the car with us. I can’t believe that this week has gone so fast. I had such an incredible time and it is bittersweet to leave. I am looking forward to seeing my friends and family and to starting my internship in a week. But I will miss the mountains, the laidback lifestyle, and the people. Especially my team members, I have spent every waking moment of the last 10 days with them and I expect I will go though a bit of separation anxiety when I have to leave them.

All in all, I am so thankful that I was given this opportunity. Traveling to Cameroon has been my dream ever since high school when I saw the EWB table at the engineering open house. I am so glad that I had the chance to work internationally and develop personal and engineering skills. There aren’t too many twenty year olds who are given that experience and I loved every second of it.

I helped shove our duffle bags and hiking backpacks into the back of the bush taxi and hugged everyone who had gathered goodbye. I squeezed myself into the backseat with a bag on my lap and waited for the car to pull away. When it did I waved and couldn’t help but look back. But afterwards I set my gaze forward excited for all of the possibilities and dreams that would come my way.
