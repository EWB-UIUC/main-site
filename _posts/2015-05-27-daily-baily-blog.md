Today is our last full day in the village and the first thing we did was have a water committee meeting.  Our goal was to reassure the community and do damage control from the discussion the previous day. The first thing that we explained was that we were still doing work with the community, and that we weren’t just dashing out on them. We explained that we were working on a solution to the exposed pipes in the rocky area, as well as we were creating a design for a new Circfa tank. You could tell by the looks on their faces that this alone made them feel better.

Secondly we had them discuss if there were any other problems with the system. After a long discussion they realized that all of the other problems that they had, they had the knowledge to fix. The water committee started to realize that the maintenance team did have a good handle on the system. We finished by explaining that our group was a water project, and that limited what we could do. We understood their desire for stoves and electricity but that for them to receive these things they would have to go though EWB USA and apply for a new project. The committee was reassured that it was not our decision to leave them, but that it was our responsibility to pass the torch.

After this long meeting I spent the rest of the afternoon playing with the children. We all went to the front yard of Pastor Julius’ house and they taught me how to do a headstand while I taught them how to do a one handed cartwheel.
