![Local School in Chichimuch]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/2015/03/IMG_0003.JPG)

Today our team visited the local school in Chichimuch.  During our visit we ran tests on the filters in the school and gave a presentation to some of the kids.  In this picture you can see the team showing one of the classes a short animation in Spanish about sanitation and hygiene. This animation was created by a University of Illinois organization called SAWBO (Scientific Animations Without Borders) that makes various free animations with numerous translations of local languages.
