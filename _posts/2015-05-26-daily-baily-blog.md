This morning Marceline made us French toast for breakfast, it was amazing. Afterwards our team went to the government school to teach those students the five senses lesson. It went even better there because those students have a better understanding of English.

This afternoon we had our big celebration to celebrate the collaboration of our group and the community.  The party began with a village meeting. Zac started off the meeting by explaining how we were so impressed with the village and how much ownership they have taken in their system. We expressed that it was getting to the point that they knew more about their system than we did. And that our responsibilities would become less and less. Julius as always translated for us, but something must have gotten lost in the translation, because the entire village started getting upset thinking that we were leaving them without a second thought. One after one people stood up and expressed their feelings of sadness and even betrayal that we were leaving them.

This was not something that we were expecting and we knew that we would have to fix these feelings before we left. After eating lunch with the village and taking pictures with all of them, our team went on a long walk to discuss how to face this new problem.
