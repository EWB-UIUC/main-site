Two informational sessions were  hosted on the 9th and 10th of September respectively in DCL1320 to share about what we do as a chapter and how members could get involved in various international development projects available in our chapter. We were glad that affliated organizations were able to participate in the event as well to expose attendees to the opportunities beyond EWB!
