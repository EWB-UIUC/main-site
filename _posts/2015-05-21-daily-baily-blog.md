This morning I learned quite a bit about water quality testing. Before I woke up Nora was already working. She is doing an independent research study to see how educating the community can affect their personal water reserves. While she was in Ntisaw last spring she taught lessons on how to collect and store water in clean buckets to reduce contamination. To follow up with these lessons she is collecting water samples from people’s personal water storages. We spent the morning testing them to see how well people took Nora’s lessons to heart. I was put in charge of testing the water’s PH as well as levels of nitrites and ammonia. This was the easiest job with just a simple drop test and color chart to reference. We also spent a considerable amount of time doing bacteria testing using 3M E. coli plates.  The method is rather simple but insightful and I am glad that I now know how to use and read them.

We spent this afternoon climbing a mountain. It was one that Nora had climbed during her semester here. It was not too much of a difficult climb, but the view was gorgeous. It is crazy how secluded we are here. There are hardly any other villages around. You look out on the horizon and see mountains rolling off into the distance. At dusk the only way to make out a village is by the little glimmer of light that reflects off of the tin roofs in the distance.
