This morning we had a traditional breakfast of puff puffs (deep fried dough balls) and nutella. It was delicious. Afterwards we got ready for a long day in the rocky area to do water sampling and testing. However, when we began our testing we realized that our bacteria plates were all contaminated. They had become damaged during our fight over and were now basically useless. We had a problem and needed to start doing some serious problem solving to fix it.  Our mentor Ann mentioned that she had a friend who worked in DNA testing and we decided that that would be our best shot. So we filled up some sample bottles to bring back home to the states for testing.  Unfortunately our only plan for the day was to do the bacteria testing, so we spent the rest of our time relaxing with the community.
