Today we traveled to Ndu for National Day. National Day occurs once a year in Cameroon; it is their equivalence of Independence Day. Cameroon was originally two parts; an English colony and a French colony. National Day is the day when these two colonies united. National Day was a really cool experience. At first I was a little nervous that I would feel so out of place. In many ways I was, but that was all right. I enjoyed watching the children march in the parade. In addition, I loved watching the crowds. Everyone had dressed up in the finest for the holiday and the colors were astonishing. That is one thing I will never forget about Cameroon. Their cities are a bit undeveloped and covered in a layer of thick red dust. But the people are bright and colorful, everything from magenta to turquoise, lime to fuchsia. And their motorbikes are just as colorful as the people as they wiz by loud and proud.

We spent the afternoon after the parade going shopping. It was fun to roam the streets and look for good deals. In comparison to the US the produce is very inexpensive so we buy many tomatoes, onions, and peppers. It is nearly impossible to purchase vegetables in Ntisaw so we try to buy what we will need for the rest of the week.
When we return from National Day we hold a Maintenance Team meeting. Our maintenance team members are Esau, Idrisu, and Tonku. I have heard a lot about them and it is exciting to meet them. They fill us in on how the system is doing and what repairs they have made. They also inform us the problems that they are facing. These being the high iron content in the water, the exposed pipes in the rocky area, and the vandalism of the Circfa tank.
