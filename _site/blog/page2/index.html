<p>This morning I learned quite a bit about water quality testing. Before I woke up Nora was already working. She is doing an independent research study to see how educating the community can affect their personal water reserves. While she was in Ntisaw last spring she taught lessons on how to collect and store water in clean buckets to reduce contamination. To follow up with these lessons she is collecting water samples from people’s personal water storages. We spent the morning testing them to see how well people took Nora’s lessons to heart. I was put in charge of testing the water’s PH as well as levels of nitrites and ammonia. This was the easiest job with just a simple drop test and color chart to reference. We also spent a considerable amount of time doing bacteria testing using 3M E. coli plates.  The method is rather simple but insightful and I am glad that I now know how to use and read them.</p>

<p>We spent this afternoon climbing a mountain. It was one that Nora had climbed during her semester here. It was not too much of a difficult climb, but the view was gorgeous. It is crazy how secluded we are here. There are hardly any other villages around. You look out on the horizon and see mountains rolling off into the distance. At dusk the only way to make out a village is by the little glimmer of light that reflects off of the tin roofs in the distance.</p>

          <p>Today we traveled to Ndu for National Day. National Day occurs once a year in Cameroon; it is their equivalence of Independence Day. Cameroon was originally two parts; an English colony and a French colony. National Day is the day when these two colonies united. National Day was a really cool experience. At first I was a little nervous that I would feel so out of place. In many ways I was, but that was all right. I enjoyed watching the children march in the parade. In addition, I loved watching the crowds. Everyone had dressed up in the finest for the holiday and the colors were astonishing. That is one thing I will never forget about Cameroon. Their cities are a bit undeveloped and covered in a layer of thick red dust. But the people are bright and colorful, everything from magenta to turquoise, lime to fuchsia. And their motorbikes are just as colorful as the people as they wiz by loud and proud.</p>

<p>We spent the afternoon after the parade going shopping. It was fun to roam the streets and look for good deals. In comparison to the US the produce is very inexpensive so we buy many tomatoes, onions, and peppers. It is nearly impossible to purchase vegetables in Ntisaw so we try to buy what we will need for the rest of the week.
When we return from National Day we hold a Maintenance Team meeting. Our maintenance team members are Esau, Idrisu, and Tonku. I have heard a lot about them and it is exciting to meet them. They fill us in on how the system is doing and what repairs they have made. They also inform us the problems that they are facing. These being the high iron content in the water, the exposed pipes in the rocky area, and the vandalism of the Circfa tank.</p>

          <br>
          <p>Today is our first true day in Ntisaw, Cameroon. We arrived in the village late last night dirty and exhausted. Our cook Marceline made us some dinner, but we could hardly taste it, we were all so excited to crawl into bed. I am a bit disappointed that we arrived at night because I couldn’t get a good look at the village until this morning. However, there is something equally as magical about that. Waking up to the sound of chickens and cows and emerging to a location unlike anything that you have ever seen. The village and all of its homes are beautiful. Everything is made of red brick and the houses are topped with shiny tin roofs. It is the wet season so everything is teaming with green life. The color is so bright and creates a beautiful contrast to the red dirt.</p>

<p>Since it is our first day in the village we do not have much planned. The biggest thing that we want to accomplish today is showing our faces to the village. To let them know that we are here and that we are looking forward to working with them. First thing in the morning we take a walk through the main road in town to say hello to people and to stop by a small shop to pick up tea. Everyone that we pass is overjoyed to see Nora. Nora is a member of our EWB group and this is her fifth trip to Ntisaw, last spring she lived in the village for five months. These people are like family to her and they are all so excited to be reunited. Everyone that we pass says good morning and asks us how we are doing with the local greeting, Wasake. They all greet us with handshakes and hugs and assure us how welcome we are in the village. Going to Ntisaw has been my dream for the past two years and I am so excited to be here.</p>

<p>When we return to Pastor Julius’ home we have a wonderful breakfast of pancakes and nutella waiting for us. We spend the rest of the morning talking to villagers and planning out the rest of the week. That afternoon we walked the water system and toured all of the water tanks. Although I had heard much about our system and tanks it solidified everything I had learned about them by seeing them in person. This walk was made much more fun by the addition of a handful of neighborhood kids. Most of the kids skipped school that day because it was our first day in the village. So everywhere we went a pack of kids went with us. And they were always eager to hold our hands. I enjoy their company; they make me feel even more welcome to the community.</p>

<p>Joe is pictured above setting up the PVC pipe to allow us to determine the amount of water that could be provided by the potential new source. We had to clear away sediment and even use a glove to prevent water from seeping through the mini-dam we built. We recorded the time it took to fill a Nalgene bottle to calculate the flow rate.</p>

<p>The above picture shows the water quality testing procedure. The water samples from various sources were stored in plastic tubes until they were ready for testing. The second picture above shows the coliform and e-coli counting procedure.  After an incubation period we counted the number of colonies present in each plate.</p>

<p>Today our team visited the local school in Chichimuch.  During our visit we ran tests on the filters in the school and gave a presentation to some of the kids.  In this picture you can see the team showing one of the classes a short animation in Spanish about sanitation and hygiene. This animation was created by a University of Illinois organization called SAWBO (Scientific Animations Without Borders) that makes various free animations with numerous translations of local languages.</p>
