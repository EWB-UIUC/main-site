&lt;p&gt;Joe is pictured above setting up the PVC pipe to allow us to determine the amount of water that could be provided by the potential new source. We had to clear away sediment and even use a glove to prevent water from seeping through the mini-dam we built. We recorded the time it took to fill a Nalgene bottle to calculate the flow rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above picture shows the water quality testing procedure. The water samples from various sources were stored in plastic tubes until they were ready for testing. The second picture above shows the coliform and e-coli counting procedure.  After an incubation period we counted the number of colonies present in each plate.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Assessment Trip</title>
   <link href="http://ewb-usa-uiuc.org///2014/08/01/assessment-trip/"/>
   <updated>2014-08-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://ewb-usa-uiuc.org//2014/08/01/assessment-trip</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2014/08/IMG_0002.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Assessment Trip&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our most recent assessment trip last August was extremely successful. During the trip, we surveyed the village households in order to gain a complete understanding of the people’s needs and expectations for this project. We also asked questions pertaining to the financial sustainability of the project. Unanimously, the people of the Likoko village said that they could afford the monthly utility bills that would come out of establishing an electric grid system. In addition to the house surveys, we created a Memorandum of Understanding and an Implementation Agreement that the village leaders agreed and signed. In these documents, the community leaders confirmed that they would be able to supply a 10% cash contribution towards the initial construction costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2014/08/IMG_0001.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Assessment Trip&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2014/08/IMG_0003.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Assessment Trip&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, during their trip, the project team met with the Mayor of Buea. He gave his blessing for the project and promised to supply government-run street lights for the municipality. Overall, there is an overwhelming support in the community for this project to go forward so we expect there to be high community involvement throughout the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2014/08/IMG_0206.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Assessment Trip&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/public/img/2014/08/IMG_0435.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Assessment Trip&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also investigated financial considerations for the project during this trip. We were able to get price estimates for installing in-house wiring. We surveyed possible transmission line routes and determined an ideal path that would connect all of the Likoko households as well as four schools to the power line. We are currently working on cost estimates for constructing a transmission line along this route. Lastly, we investigated potential future projects such as health education and electrically powered water distribution, which could be our next steps after implementing the electrical grid system.&lt;/p&gt;
