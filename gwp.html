info: The water filtration project in Socorro, Guatemala is a success with over 1000 biosand filters implemented in households in ten communities within the region. With the collaboration between EWB-USA UIUC and a local NGO, the group is hoping to start a new water project in Guatemala in the coming year. This will involve a lot of discussions with community and NGO partners, project planning, and fundraising.
