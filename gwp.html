info: The Chichimuch Water Supply Project aims to find good water source and construct a sustainable water distribution system in the community of Chichimuch to help alleviate their water scarcity problem. Chichimuch has plentiful water during wet season, but very limited water access in dry season, which lasts around 6 months. Now, a potential water source has been found and is under analysis for quality, quantity, and feasibility as the source for the new system. <br><br> The water filtration project in Socorro, Guatemala is a success with over 1000 biosand filters implemented in households in ten communities within the region. A substantial improvement of health condition of the residents from these regions was observed after the implementation of the filters and the NGO is working with more communities to bring in to the biosand filters to improve drinking water quality.
