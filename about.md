Engineers Without Borders is an international organization which strives to develop bottom-up sustainable growth at the community level in the developing world. With over 12,000 members, and 350 projects in 45 different countries, EWB has had a profound impact on the lives of millions of people around the world. EWB-USA UIUC is one of the largest Engineers Without Borders student chapters in the USA. Founded in 2004, the chapter has grown to include three international programs in Nigeria, Guatemala and Cameroon, and over 150 active members. Although the projects constitute the heart and soul of our EWB vision, our chapter looks forward to future growth in many diverse areas. These include the development of new curriculae focused on international development through the College of Engineering, and the creation of chapter-wide workshops and training seminars. The bottom line? You donâ€™t need to be an engineer to make a significant difference in our chapter!

# Our Vision
A world in which the communities we serve have the capacity to sustainably meet their basic human needs, and where our members have enriched global perspectives through their interactions with EWB-USA initiatives.

# Our Mission
Engineers Without Borders promotes community-driven engineering projects fostered by local partners for a sustainable global future. We foster leadership and personal growth within our student members through the transformative experiences embedded in our projects.
