info: The Nigeria Water Project started in 2005 when the EWB UIUC team took over the project. The EWB UIUC team and the people of Adu Achi, a village in Southeastern Nigeria, are working to  bring clean water to the people of Adu Achi by developing and managing a sustainable water source. The complex design of the water source allows public and private taps and also provides income to the community though the sale of water to other communities. The EWB UIUC team has taken several trips to the area including one site assessment trip, three implementation trips, and two monitoring trips. The site assessment trip took place in August 2006 and included collecting water demand data, creating village maps, investigating the area for potential sites for borehole and storage tank construction, and testing the water quality of the area then. In December 2007, the first implementation trip took place and the ferrocement storage tanks were partially constructed. These storage tanks were completed in the May 2008 implementation trip. Also on this trip, the 500 foot borehole well was drilled and cased and 850 feet of distribution system of two public tap stands were constructed. The final implementation trip in May 2009 saw the installation of the electric submersible pump, the construction of a mile of the distribution system and two public tap stands, and the connection of the water source to several houses. The project then went into a monitoring phase with the first monitoring trip in December 2011 as the team reviewed the status of the system and the progress that had been made, trained local employees, facilitated restructuring of the local management committee, completed repairs on the system, and constructed a tap stand for tanker trucks. In May 2013, the latest monitoring trip took place. Current work on the project includes fundraising, continuously advising the water committee on operation of the system, developing long term partnerships with local organizations, and considering small additions/improvements to the system.
