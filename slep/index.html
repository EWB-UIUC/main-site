  <h1>Soppo Likoko Electricity Project</h1>
  <p>The newest project at UIUC is an electricity project in Soppo Likoko, Cameroon. The community of Soppo Likoko and EWB-USA UIUC started working together in April 2013.  The Soppo Likoko power project started in fall 2013 with our first trip to the area in January 2014. During that trip, we made our first assessment of the possibility of an electrification project for the community. This initial positive assessment was followed up with a second trip in August 2014 in which we determined the details of what the electrification scheme would look like. Now, we are working on pre-implementation before making a third trip to oversee realization of the project.  We plan to construct an electrical grid system that will provide electricity to 50 households and 4 schools.</p>
